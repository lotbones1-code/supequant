  breakout:
    # Consolidation range: Increased from 3% to 5% for SOL volatility
    consolidation_range_pct: 0.05  # Was 0.03 (3%)
    
    # Volume requirement: Reduced to 80% of average (was 120%)
    volume_multiplier: 0.8  # Was 1.2 (120% of average)
    
    # Volatility compression: Relaxed to ATR < 1.5x average
    atr_compression_multiplier: 1.5  # Was: percentile < 40 or is_compressed
    
    # Breakout detection: Already relaxed to 0.05% (was 0.1%)

    # Consolidation bars: Keep at 15
    consolidation_bars: 15
    
    # Max breaks allowed: Keep at 2
    max_breaks: 2

# To use these settings, update config.py:
# BREAKOUT_VOLUME_MULTIPLIER = 0.8
# In breakout_strategy.py:
# - Change range_pct > 0.03 to range_pct > 0.05 (line 136)
# - Change compression check to ATR < 1.5x average (line 105)
# - Change volume check to volume_ratio >= 0.8 (line 208)
