# ✅ FIXED! Here's How to Run It

## The Problem
You were running `python3 main.py` which uses system Python, not the venv Python where numpy is installed.

## The Solution

### Option 1: Use the Run Script (EASIEST)
```bash
./run
```

### Option 2: Activate Venv First
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

### Option 3: One-Liner
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && python main.py
```
