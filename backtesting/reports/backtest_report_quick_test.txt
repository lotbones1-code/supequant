RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

🔧 FILTER TUNING: Pass rate is very low (<10%). Consider:
   - Loosening threshold requirements
   - Disabling overly restrictive filters
   - Reviewing filter logic for false rejections
⚠️  SUSPICIOUSLY HIGH WIN RATE: >70% may indicate:
   - Overfitting to historical data
   - Stops too wide (cutting winners too early)
   - Need for out-of-sample testing
❌ NEGATIVE EXPECTANCY: Profit factor < 1.0
   - System is losing money
   - DO NOT trade this live
   - Major strategy revision needed
⚠️  INSUFFICIENT SAMPLE SIZE: < 30 trades
   - Results may not be statistically significant
   - Test on longer time period
   - Minimum 100 trades recommended for validation
✅ EXCELLENT RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS: Sharpe > 2.0
   - Strong risk/return profile
   - Verify results with forward testing
